# k8sss

Get access to your Kubernetes cluster using your SSH key (or YubiKey, TPM chip,
Google login, anything [supported by Smallstep](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/provisioners/) really).

Note that the key itself is not used for accessing the cluster, instead `k8sss`
generates a key on disk and obtains a short-lived kube-api client certificate
(30 min.) that is reissued every 15 min.  
To authenticate with your cluster directly via an HSM see [step-kmsproxy-plugin](https://github.com/orbit-online/step-kmsproxy-plugin).

## Installation

The [Kubernetes manifest](deploy/kube-client-ca.yaml) can be deployed by
fetching the repo and running `kubectl apply -k deploy/`.  
The deployment mounts the kube-api client CA certificate as a `hostPath` from
`/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/client-ca.crt`, so `k3s` is assumed, see
[Customizing access](#customizing-access) for changing how you authenticate.

The `k8sss` tool can be installed through [Î¼pkg](https://github.com/orbit-online/upkg).
Check [the latest release](https://github.com/andsens/k8sss/releases/latest) for
a copy & paste string with the proper shasum.

```

## Client setup

Run `k8sss setup <kube-api>:6443` and you're done.

```
$ k8sss setup nas:6443
k8sss: No trust has been established with this Kubernetes cluster yet.
The root certificate fingerprint is f2ca1bb6c7e907d06dafe4687e579fce76b37e4e93b7605022da52e6ccc26fd2

$ kubectl --context nas -n kube-system get pod

```

Run `k8sss --help` for details on how to adjust things like the smallstep CA
endpoint (assumed to be `<kube-api>:9000`), the Kubernetes username
(`system:admin`), or what key to use for authentication.

## Customizing access

The CA [setup script](deploy/setup-kube-client-ca-config.sh) reads each line
from `/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys` (mounted via `hostPath`) and converts
it to a JWK that is added to the step-ca provisioner config.

The script and the deployment need to be modified if you wish to change
how step-ca authenticates users.

... or, you remove the `setup_authorized_keys()` part in the [setup script](deploy/setup-kube-client-ca-config.sh)
and hardcode your authentication method directly in `deploy/kube-client-ca.json`.
